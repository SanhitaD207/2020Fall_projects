##Hypotheses

####Hypothesis - I
Of all collisions occurring late in the night (between 12 am - 5 am), the majority are caused due to overspeeding.

####Hypothesis - II
Of all crashes, a majority number is caused by persons between the age of 16-25.

####Hypothesis - III
The number of collisions increased with an increase in population

####Hypothesis - IV
Crash locations are not random. The collisions are bound to specific areas due to a badly planned network of roads/traffic signs.
